<h1 id="intro">Introduction</h1>
Movie Night is a Movie-swiping app to bring you a seamless and painless Movie Night Experience.

<h1 id="user_guide">User Guide</h1>
<h3><b>User Registration:</b></h3>
Upon opening the App, u need to register your account. For utilizing the app's features, you are recommended to create a pair.
<h3><b>Swiper:</b></h3>
Swiper consists of different movies from the netflix japan database. If you swipe right (like) a movie, it will be recorded to the database which has two effects: 
<br>
<p>  1.Our <b>Recommendation Algorithm</b> which listens to your likes and recommend movies that you may a higher chance to like.
<p>  2.Our <b>Matches Mechanism</b> that tracks if you and your partner (in a pair) has a match.

When you have a match, you will see an alert box if you are the second swiper; or a notification message, if you are the first swiper and you are outside of the app.

If you click on the movie poster, you can see the details of a movie including title, synopsis, genre and runtime.

You can also click on the filter button to filter movies by genre.

<h3><b>Rush Mode:</b></h3>
Rush Mode is for people who do not have game to user the app, and/or pairs who still do not have a match by the night. In this mode, you and your partner will have a 30-seconds swiping session synchronously with the same movies provided.
<h3><b>Matches:</b></h3>
in Matches you can see all the past match you and your partner has made. You can click on the movie poster to see the movie info, and inside you can deleted the watched movie(which deletes it from your list of match history).
<h3><b>Profile:</b></h3>
in Profile, you can see you user information and what pair you belong to. You can also upload your own profile picture, which will be shown in the rush mode screen.
